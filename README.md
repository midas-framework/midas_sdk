A set of SDK's for building tasks with midas.
Note this is not meant to be an exhaustive set for any given usecase.
Instead if functions as quick implemetations of scripts and automations,
this is the usecase midas wants to champion using Gleam for.
This package can also be used as examples for how to implement sdk's that work with midas.

```sh
gleam add midas_sdk@1
```
```gleam
import midas_sdk

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/midas_sdk>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
